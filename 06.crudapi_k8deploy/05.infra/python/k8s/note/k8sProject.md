# Kubernetes Manifests — Instagram API

All six manifests used to deploy the Flask Instagram API and its Postgres database to Kubernetes, collected in one file for easy reference. Apply individually (`kubectl apply -f k8s/<file>`) or all at once (`kubectl apply -f k8s/`).

Recommended apply order: `ConfigMap.yml` → `Secrets.yml` → `Pvc.yml` → `deployment.yml` → `Services.yml` → `Hpa.yml`. See `k8s_deployment_guide.md` for the full explanation of every field.

## `ConfigMap.yml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: instagram-config
  labels:
    app: instagram-api
data:
  # Non-secret configuration — anything that's fine to see in plaintext.
  # Pulled into containers as environment variables (see deployment.yml).
  DB_HOST: "postgres-service" # the Postgres Service name — Kubernetes DNS resolves this automatically
  DB_PORT: "5432"
  DB_NAME: "instagram_clone"
  FLASK_ENV: "production"
```

---

## `Secrets.yml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: instagram-secret
  labels:
    app: instagram-api
type: Opaque
data:
  # Values here MUST be base64-encoded — Kubernetes does NOT encrypt this for you,
  # it's just an encoding, not real security. Anyone who can `kubectl get secret -o yaml`
  # can decode this instantly with `echo "<value>" | base64 -d`.
  # Generate these yourself with: echo -n "postgres" | base64
  DB_USER: cG9zdGdyZXM= # "postgres"
  DB_PASSWORD: eW91cnBhc3N3b3Jk # "yourpassword"
```

---

## `Pvc.yml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: postgres-pvc
  labels:
    app: postgres
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce # only one Node can mount this for read/write at a time — fine, since we run a single Postgres Pod
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
  # storageClassName omitted on purpose -> uses your cluster's default StorageClass
  # (e.g. "standard" on most managed clusters). Set it explicitly if your cluster
  # has no default, e.g.: storageClassName: standard
```

## `deployment.yml`

```yaml

# ====================================================================
# POSTGRES DEPLOYMENT
# A plain Deployment, NOT a StatefulSet — by design.
#
# StatefulSet exists to manage MULTIPLE replicas of stateful pods that each
# need a stable identity and their OWN separate volume (pod-0 gets its own
# disk, pod-1 gets its own disk, etc, and they keep that same disk across
# restarts/rescheduling). We don't need any of that here: we are running
# exactly ONE Postgres pod, with ONE PVC, that pod is mounted to. A regular
# Deployment with replicas: 1 gives us that, with far less complexity.
# ====================================================================
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: postgres-deployment
  labels:
    app: postgres
spec:
  replicas:
    1 # MUST stay at 1 — Postgres's own data files are not safe to
    # share across multiple writers pointed at the same disk.
    # Scaling this up would NOT give you more capacity, it would
    # give you data corruption. (Real horizontal scaling for
    # Postgres needs a different setup entirely — replication,
    # not duplicate pods on one PVC.)
  strategy:
    type:
      Recreate # IMPORTANT: must be Recreate, not the default RollingUpdate.
      # RollingUpdate would try to start a NEW postgres pod
      # before killing the old one — but our PVC is ReadWriteOnce,
      # so only one pod can mount it at a time. Recreate kills
      # the old pod fully before starting the new one, avoiding
      # a deadlock where two pods both want the same disk.

    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds:

# NOTE: the HPA only targets the Flask API Deployment, never the Postgres
# Deployment. Postgres is stateful and pinned to one PVC — autoscaling it
# would try to spin up a second pod fighting over the same ReadWriteOnce
# disk, which is exactly the failure mode the `Recreate` strategy and
# replicas: 1 in deployment.yml are protecting against.
