# Building an Instagram-Style API in Flask — From Zero to Long-Polling

This builds directly on your SQL notes (`users`, `posts`, `likes`). We'll go from "what is a route" all the way to a working API with JWT auth and real-time-ish updates via long polling — **twice**: once with raw SQL (`psycopg2`), once with an ORM (SQLAlchemy). Same features, same endpoints, two implementations, so you can compare line-by-line.

## 1. Project Setup & How Routing Works

### What even is a route?

A Flask app is, at its core, a big dictionary: **"if a request comes in for this URL + this HTTP method, run this function."** `@api.route(...)` is the decorator that registers that mapping.

```python
from flask import Flask

api = Flask(__name__)

@api.route("/ping", methods=["GET"])
def ping():
    return {"message": "pong"}, 200
```

Breaking this down:

- `api = Flask(__name__)` creates the application object. `__name__` tells Flask where the app's root folder is (for finding templates/static files — not important here).
- `@api.route("/ping", methods=["GET"])` registers the function `ping` to handle `GET /ping`.
- The function returns a dict — Flask automatically converts it to JSON, plus an explicit status code `200`.
- Without `methods=[...]`, Flask defaults to `GET` only.

### Dynamic route segments

```python
@api.route("/users/<int:user_id>", methods=["GET"])
def get_user(user_id):
    ...
```

`<int:user_id>` means "match a number here and pass it into the function as the integer `user_id`." You can also use `<string:username>` or just `<username>` (string is the default converter).

### Reading the request body

```python
from flask import request

@api.route("/posts", methods=["POST"])
def create_post():
    data = request.get_json()   # parses incoming JSON body into a Python dict
    caption = data.get("caption")
    ...
```

## 2. Short Polling vs Long Polling vs WebSocket

You explicitly asked to skip WebSocket and use long polling — but understanding all three side by side makes clear _why_.

### Short Polling

The client asks "anything new?" over and over, on a fixed timer, **regardless of whether anything happened**.

```
Client: "New likes on post 101?"  → Server: "No"      (t=0s)
Client: "New likes on post 101?"  → Server: "No"      (t=2s)
Client: "New likes on post 101?"  → Server: "Yes! +3"  (t=4s)
Client: "New likes on post 101?"  → Server: "No"      (t=6s)
```

- **Pros:** dead simple — a plain HTTP request on a `setInterval`.
- **Cons:** wasteful. Most requests return "nothing changed," but you still pay the cost of opening a connection, hitting your server/DB, and closing it, every single time. At scale this is a lot of pointless load. There's also a delay (latency) up to your poll interval before the client learns of new data.

### Long Polling

The client asks "anything new?" but the **server holds the request open** ("hangs") and only responds **once something actually changes** (or a timeout is hit). The moment it responds, the client immediately re-asks.

```
Client: "New likes on post 101?" ──(server holds connection open)──...
                                   ...3 seconds pass, no likes yet...
                                   ...a like arrives!...
                  Server responds: "Yes! +1"          (t=3s)
Client immediately re-asks: "New likes on post 101?" ──(holds again)──...
```

- **Pros:** much closer to real-time than short polling, no wasted "no" responses, and crucially — **it's just plain HTTP**. No special protocol, no persistent socket, works through any proxy/firewall that already allows HTTP, easy to implement in Flask with zero extra libraries.
- **Cons:** still one full HTTP request per "event," and the server has to keep that request's worker/thread occupied while waiting (this is exactly where the **global lock** discussion below comes in). Doesn't scale as well as WebSockets for _very_ high-frequency, many-thousands-of-clients use cases.

### WebSocket

A **single persistent, two-way connection** is opened once and stays open. Either side can push messages over it at any time, with no "asking" needed.

```
Client ⇄ Server   (one connection, opened once)
Server → Client: "New like!"   (pushed instantly, whenever it happens)
Server → Client: "New post!"   (pushed instantly, whenever it happens)
```

- **Pros:** truest "real-time," lowest latency, most efficient at scale for high-frequency push.
- **Cons:** needs a different protocol (`ws://`), a persistent connection per client (different infrastructure/load-balancer considerations), and a different programming model (event-driven, not request/response). More moving parts to learn and deploy.

### Why long polling is the right choice for _this_ project

It gets you 90% of the "feels real-time" experience of WebSockets, using nothing but Flask routes you already know how to write. It's the natural stepping stone between "the client polls dumbly every 2 seconds" and "I need a whole separate WebSocket server."

---

## 3. The Global Lock — Why We Need It

### The problem long polling creates

A long-polling endpoint works by **blocking** (waiting) inside the request handler until new data shows up. If our "new data" detector is a plain Python variable like:

```python
latest_like_event = None
```

...then **multiple requests, possibly from multiple threads, are all reading and writing this same variable at the same time.** Flask's dev server (and most production WSGI servers like `gunicorn` with threaded workers) will happily run your route function on multiple threads concurrently. Without protection, two things can happen:

1. **Race conditions:** Thread A reads `latest_like_event`, thread B updates it, then thread A overwrites it back to a stale value — a client misses an update.
2. **Inconsistent reads:** Thread A is in the middle of updating a dict (`{"post_id": ..., "likes": ...}`) when thread B reads it half-written.

### The fix: a `Lock`

Python's `threading.Lock` guarantees that **only one thread at a time** can execute the code inside `with lock:` — every other thread that tries gets paused until the lock is free.

```python
import threading

lock = threading.Lock()
latest_event = {"type": None, "data": None, "version": 0}

def publish_event(event_type, data):
    global latest_event
    with lock:                      # only one thread can be inside here at once
        latest_event["type"] = event_type
        latest_event["data"] = data
        latest_event["version"] += 1   # bump a counter so clients can detect "is this new?"
```

We call this our **"global lock"** because it's a single lock shared across the whole app, protecting the single shared piece of state (`latest_event`) that _every_ long-polling client is watching.

### How the long-polling loop uses it

```python
def wait_for_new_event(since_version, timeout=25):
    start = time.time()
    while time.time() - start < timeout:
        with lock:
            if latest_event["version"] > since_version:
                return latest_event.copy()   # something changed — return immediately
        time.sleep(0.5)   # nothing new yet, sleep briefly before checking again
    return None   # timed out, nothing happened
```

This is "long polling" implemented as a **short internal poll, hidden behind one long-held HTTP request** — the client only sees one slow request, but under the hood the server is checking the shared state every half-second until something changes or 25 seconds pass, whichever comes first. We use the lock every single time we touch `latest_event`, whether reading or writing, so no two threads ever see a half-updated value.

## 4. JWT Authentication, From Scratch

### What problem JWT solves

HTTP is stateless — the server doesn't remember you between requests. After a user logs in, we need a way for every _future_ request to prove "this is still user #1, already verified." A **JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a signed, tamper-proof string the server hands the client after login; the client sends it back on every subsequent request (usually via the `Authorization` header), and the server can verify it instantly **without hitting the database** — because the token's signature is checked with a secret key only the server knows.

### Anatomy of a JWT

A JWT looks like `xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz` — three base64-encoded parts separated by dots:

| Part          | Contains                                    | Example                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Header**    | algorithm used                              | `{"alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT"}`    |
| **Payload**   | your actual data ("claims")                 | `{"user_id": 1, "exp": 1750000000}` |
| **Signature** | `HMAC-SHA256(header + payload, SECRET_KEY)` | unreadable hash                     |

Anyone can _read_ the payload (it's just base64, not encrypted) — but only someone with `SECRET_KEY` can produce a _valid_ signature for it. So if a client tampers with the payload (e.g. changes `user_id` from 1 to 2), the signature no longer matches, and the server's verification step rejects the token.

### Issuing a token (login)

```python
import jwt
import datetime

SECRET_KEY = "change-this-to-a-real-secret-in-production"

def create_token(user_id):
    payload = {
        "user_id": user_id,
        "exp": datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(days=7),  # expiry
        "iat": datetime.datetime.utcnow(),                                # issued-at
    }
    return jwt.encode(payload, SECRET_KEY, algorithm="HS256")
```

### Verifying a token on every protected request

```python
from functools import wraps
from flask import request, jsonify

def token_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
        auth_header = request.headers.get("Authorization", "")
        if not auth_header.startswith("Bearer "):
            return jsonify({"error": "Missing or malformed Authorization header"}), 401

        token = auth_header.split(" ")[1]
        try:
            payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
        except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
            return jsonify({"error": "Token expired"}), 401
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
            return jsonify({"error": "Invalid token"}), 401

        request.user_id = payload["user_id"]   # stash it for the route to use
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated
```

This is a **decorator** — wrap any route with `@token_required` and it automatically blocks unauthenticated requests before your route's own code ever runs:

```python
@api.route("/posts", methods=["POST"])
@token_required
def create_post():
    user_id = request.user_id   # set by token_required above
    ...
```

### The client's job

1. `POST /login` with username/password → gets back `{"token": "xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz"}`.
2. Stores that token (e.g. in memory, or `localStorage` on web — outside our scope here).
3. Sends it on every future request: header `Authorization: Bearer xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`.

---

## 5. Database Schema

Identical to your SQL notes — we're not changing the data model at all:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id      SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username     VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email        VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    bio          TEXT,
    created_at   TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE posts (
    post_id      SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id      INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id),
    caption      TEXT,
    image_url    VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at   TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE likes (
    user_id      INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id),
    post_id      INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES posts(post_id),
    liked_at     TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, post_id)
);
```

(We added `password_hash` to `users` since we now need to authenticate people — never store plain-text passwords.)

## 6. Version 1 — Raw SQL API (`psycopg2`)

In this version, _you_ write every SQL statement, and `psycopg2` just sends it to Postgres and gives you back rows as tuples.

```python
# app_raw_sql.py
import threading
import time
import jwt
import datetime
import psycopg2
import psycopg2.extras
from functools import wraps
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

api = Flask(__name__)
SECRET_KEY = "change-this-to-a-real-secret-in-production"

DB_CONFIG = dict(
    dbname="instagram_clone",
    user="postgres",
    password="yourpassword",
    host="localhost",
    port=5432,
)

def get_db():
    # a fresh connection per request — simplest possible approach for learning.
    # In production you'd use a connection pool (e.g. psycopg2.pool, or pgbouncer).
    conn = psycopg2.connect(**DB_CONFIG)
    conn.autocommit = True
    return conn

### Notes on Version 1

- `cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.RealDictCursor` makes rows come back as dicts (`{"user_id": 1, ...}`) instead of plain tuples, so we can `jsonify()` them directly.
- `RETURNING ...` on `INSERT`/`UPDATE` is Postgres-specific syntax that hands back the row you just wrote, in the same round-trip — no need for a second `SELECT`.
- We catch `psycopg2.errors.UniqueViolation` to turn "duplicate like" (violating our composite PK) into a clean `409 Conflict` instead of a raw 500 error.
- `threaded=True` in `api.run(...)` is **not optional** — without it, Flask's dev server handles one request at a time, and a long-polling request would freeze your entire server for every other user until it times out.

## 7. Version 2 — SQLAlchemy ORM API

Same exact endpoints, same behavior — but instead of writing SQL strings, we define Python classes (**models**) that represent tables, and call methods/attributes on them. SQLAlchemy translates that into SQL behind the scenes.

```python
# models.py
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from datetime import datetime

db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=False)
    bio = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)

    posts = db.relationship("Post", backref="author", lazy=True)
    likes = db.relationship("Like", backref="user", lazy=True)

    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            "user_id": self.user_id,
            "username": self.username,
            "email": self.email,
            "bio": self.bio,
        }


class Post(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "posts"
    post_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("users.user_id"), nullable=False)
    caption = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    image_url = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=False)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)

    likes = db.relationship("Like", backref="post", lazy=True)

    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            "post_id": self.post_id,
            "user_id": self.user_id,
            "username": self.author.username,
            "caption": self.caption,
            "image_url": self.image_url,
            "created_at": str(self.created_at),
            "like_count": len(self.likes),
        }


class Like(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "likes"
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("users.user_id"), primary_key=True)
    post_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("posts.post_id"), primary_key=True)
    liked_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
```

Notice: `db.relationship(...)` is the ORM's way of expressing the FK relationships from your SQL notes — `User.posts` gives you every `Post` row belonging to a user **without writing a JOIN yourself**; SQLAlchemy generates it. `primary_key=True` on _both_ `user_id` and `post_id` in `Like` is exactly the **composite key** from your notes, just expressed in Python instead of `PRIMARY KEY (user_id, post_id)`.

### Raw SQL vs ORM — what actually changed

| Concern                   | Raw SQL (Version 1)                      | ORM (Version 2)                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Table definitions         | `schema.sql`, run manually               | Python classes in `models.py`, `db.create_all()`                     |
| Inserting a row           | Hand-written `INSERT ... RETURNING`      | `db.session.add(obj)` + `db.session.commit()`                        |
| Reading a row             | Hand-written `SELECT ... WHERE`          | `Model.query.filter_by(...)` / `Model.query.get(...)`                |
| Joins                     | Written explicitly (`JOIN posts ON ...`) | Often implicit via `relationship()` (`post.author.username`)         |
| Duplicate-like protection | Catch `psycopg2.errors.UniqueViolation`  | Catch `IntegrityError`, or check via `Like.query.get(...)` first     |
| Composite PK              | `PRIMARY KEY (user_id, post_id)` in SQL  | Two columns both marked `primary_key=True` in the model              |
| What you actually control | Every query, fully                       | SQLAlchemy generates the SQL — you describe _what_, it decides _how_ |

**The long-polling logic, the JWT logic, and the global lock are 100% identical in both versions** — those concerns live entirely outside the database layer, which is exactly why we could swap SQL for an ORM without touching them at all.

## 8. The Long-Polling Endpoint, Line by Line

```python
@api.route("/events/poll", methods=["GET"])
def poll_events():
    since_version = int(request.args.get("since", 0))
    event = wait_for_new_event(since_version)
    if event is None:
        return jsonify({"timeout": True, "version": since_version}), 204
    return jsonify(event), 200
```

- `request.args.get("since", 0)` — the client tells us "the last event version I already know about." First call ever, it sends `since=0`.
- `wait_for_new_event(since_version)` — this is where the magic happens: the function **does not return immediately**. It loops, checking the shared `latest_event` (protected by `lock`) every 0.5 seconds, for up to 25 seconds, looking for a version number higher than what the client already has.
- If something new happened during that window → return it immediately, with its new version number.
- If nothing happened in 25 seconds → return `204` (no content) with a `timeout` flag. The client treats this exactly like "no news," and should **immediately call `/events/poll` again** — this re-opening is what makes it "long polling" rather than "one giant request that eventually just gives up."

### The matching client-side loop (JavaScript, for context — not part of the Flask app)

```javascript
let sinceVersion = 0;

async function pollLoop() {
  while (true) {
    const res = await fetch(`/events/poll?since=${sinceVersion}`);
    if (res.status === 200) {
      const event = await res.json();
      sinceVersion = event.version;
      handleEvent(event); // e.g. update the UI: bump a like counter, show a new post
    }
    // whether it was a real event or a timeout, immediately loop and ask again
  }
}

function handleEvent(event) {
  if (event.type === "new_like") {
    document.getElementById(`like-count-${event.data.post_id}`).innerText =
      event.data.like_count;
  } else if (event.type === "new_post") {
    prependPostToFeed(event.data);
  }
}

pollLoop();
```

This client never sleeps on a timer (unlike short polling) — it just immediately re-asks the moment it gets _any_ response, real or timeout. The server is doing all the "waiting" work.

### Why this specific design choice — a single `latest_event`, not a queue

For learning purposes we keep **one shared "latest event," with a version counter**, rather than a full event queue per client. This is intentionally simple:

- ✅ Simple to understand and implement with just a `Lock` and a dict.
- ✅ Works great for "everyone watching the global feed sees the same updates."
- ⚠️ **Limitation:** if two events happen in the same instant before a client polls, the client only sees the _latest_ one — it doesn't see a full history of everything it missed. For a real production app, you'd replace `latest_event` with a list (a small ring buffer) of the last N events, and have `wait_for_new_event` return _all_ events newer than `since_version`, not just the newest one. The locking pattern stays exactly the same — only the data structure being protected changes.

## 9. Testing the API (example requests)

```bash
# Sign up
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "priya_d", "email": "priya@example.com", "password": "secret123"}'

# Log in (grab the token from the response)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "priya_d", "password": "secret123"}'

# Create a post (note the Bearer token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN HERE>" \
  -d '{"caption": "Golden hour shoot", "image_url": "https://cdn.example.com/img3.jpg"}'

# Like a post
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/posts/1/like \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN HERE>"

# Long-poll for updates (this call will "hang" until something happens, or ~25s pass)
curl "http://localhost:5000/events/poll?since=0"
```

Open two terminals: in one, run the `curl .../events/poll?since=0` command and watch it hang. In the other, like a post. The first terminal should immediately return with the like event — that's long polling working.

---

## 10. Where To Go From Here

- **Connection pooling:** replace `psycopg2.connect(...)` per-request with `psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool`, or for the ORM version, SQLAlchemy already pools connections for you by default.
- **Pagination on the feed:** already there via `limit`/`offset` — try adding cursor-based pagination (using `created_at` + `post_id` as a cursor) as a SQL-skills exercise straight from your notes (subqueries/CTEs).
- **Multiple events in flight:** swap `latest_event` for a small ring-buffer list, as mentioned in Section 8.
- **Refresh tokens:** JWTs here just expire after 7 days and force a re-login; a production app usually pairs a short-lived **access token** with a long-lived **refresh token** stored more securely.
- **Followers table:** your SQL notes already describe this — a `follows` table with `follower_id`/`followee_id`, both FKs to `users`, composite PK — try adding `/users/<id>/follow` as a follow-up exercise using everything covered here.
